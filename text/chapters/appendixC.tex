\section*{Značajke slike}
Serijalizirane značajke slike zapisuju se za svaku znamenku pojedinačno. Svakoj znamenci na slici dodjeljuje se labela
i indeks pozicije gledano s lijeve strane slike. Za svaku znamenku koristi se jedna linija u izlaznoj tekstualnoj
datoteci kako bi se zapisale njene značajke. Format te linije je oblika:\\
\footnotesize
\texttt{\{label=<labela>;file=<ime datoteke>;index=<indeks>;(<značajke>;)\}}\\
\normalsize
Labela će uvijek biti cijeli broj u rasponu $[0, 9]$ ili znakovni niz \emph{``none''} dok je indeks cijeli broj u
rasponu $[0, n - 1]$ gdje je $n$ broj znamenaka na slici. Značajke čini lista od 36 brojeva u rasponu $[0, 1]$ međusobno
odvojenih zarezom. Primjer\footnote{Vrijednosti svih značajki zaokružene su na jednu decimalu radi kraćeg zapisa;
zapis u stvarnoj datoteci sadrži više decimala.} serijalizirane slike na kojoj se nalazi broj $1234567890$ prikazan je u
nastavku.\\

\section*{Neuronska mreža}
Neuronska mreža serijalizira se tako da se svaki njen sloj zapiše u jednoj liniji teksta koristeći sljedeći
format:\\
\footnotesize
\texttt{\{in=<broj ulaza>;out=<broj izlaza>;((<težine prvog neurona>);(<težine drugog neurona>);...\}}\\
\normalsize
Težine neurona čini lista brojeva odvojenih zarezom nakon koje slijedi znak \emph{`;'} i još jedan broj koji označava
vrijednost slobodnog težinskog faktora $w_0$. Težine su poredane na način tako da se svaka $i$-ta težina dodjeljuje
vrijednosti izlaza $i$-tog neurona u prethodnom sloju. Slojevi neuronske mreže su u izlaznoj datoteci poredani od
izlaznog sloja prema ulaznom sloju. U nastavku je primjer\footnote{Kao i kod primjera zapisa značajki, sve decimalne
vrijednosti zaokružene su na jednu decimalu radi kraćeg zapisa.} ovakvog zapisa za neuronsku mrežu dimenzija
$36 \times 15 \times 10 \times 5 \times 10$.\\
